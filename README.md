# Mimir

**Your Self-Evolving Engineering Playbook**

Mimir helps you work more effectively by providing structured playbooks that your AI assistant can access directly in your IDE. Get guidance, generate work plans, track progress, and continuously improve your development process.

> For architecture and design details, see [docs/architecture/SAO.md](docs/architecture/SAO.md)

## Core Entities

Mimir organizes your playbooks using **7 core entities**:

1. **Playbook** - Top-level methodology container (e.g., "FDD", "Scrum")
2. **Workflow** - Sequence of activities for a process (e.g., "Build Feature")
3. **Phase** *(optional)* - Grouping for activities within workflows (e.g., "Inception", "Construction")
4. **Activity** - Unit of work with guidance (e.g., "Create screen mockup")
5. **Artifact** - Inputs/outputs of activities (e.g., "Component Specification", "Unit Tests")
6. **Role** - Who performs activities (e.g., "Frontend Engineer", "UX Designer")
7. **Howto** - Specific implementation instructions (e.g., "Creating mockups with Figma")

## What Can Mimir Do?

### Answer Playbook Questions via MCP

Your AI assistant can query Mimir directly from your IDE (powered by FastMCP):

```
You: "How do I build a TSX component per FDD playbook?"
AI: → Queries Mimir → Returns activity guidance and relevant Howtos
```

### Generate Work Plans

Automatically create task breakdowns in GitHub or Jira:

```
You: "Plan implementation of scenario LOG1.1 and Screen LOG per FDD"
AI: → Generates work orders from playbook → Creates GitHub issues
```

### Assess Project Progress

Check if you've completed all required artifacts for a phase:

```
You: "I'm supposed to finish inception phase next week. Did I produce all required artifacts?"
AI: → Scans codebase and issues → Reports status and gaps
```

### Evolve Through Experience

When AI encounters issues during work, it can propose playbook improvements:

```
AI: → Detects repeated corrections → Creates Playbook Improvement Proposal (PIP)
You: → Reviews PIP in web UI → Approves with notes → New playbook version created
```

### Access Playbook Library

Download playbooks from HOMEBASE based on your access level:
- **Family-based**: Software Engineering, UX Design, Testing, etc.
- **Version tiers**: LITE (Basic), FULL (Standard), EXTENDED (Premium)

## Quick Start with Docker

Two containers: **FOB** (Django web UI + API) and **MCP Facade** (connects your AI IDE to FOB).

### Step 1 — Run FOB

```bash
# Authenticate to ECR (one-time)
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
    411113550285.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# Run with persistent storage
docker run -d \
  --name mimir-fob \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ~/mimir-data:/app/data \
  -e MIMIR_USER=admin \
  -e MIMIR_PASSWORD=changeme \
  -e MIMIR_EMAIL=admin@localhost \
  411113550285.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mimir:latest

open http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 2 — Get your API token

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/ \
  -d "username=admin&password=changeme" | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token'])"
```

### Step 3 — Configure MCP in your IDE

The MCP facade is published as a **public Docker Hub image** (`featurefactory/mimir-mcp`) — no registry login needed.

**Windsurf** (`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`), **Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`), **Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mimir": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000",
        "-e", "TOKEN=<your-token>",
        "-e", "MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio",
        "featurefactory/mimir-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<your-token>` with the token from Step 2. Restart your IDE after saving.

> **Multi-platform**: amd64 + arm64 · **Data safety**: SQLite in mounted volume · **Hosted FOB**: change `BASE_URL` to `https://mimir.featurefactory.io`

See [docs/DOCKER_QUICK_START.md](docs/DOCKER_QUICK_START.md) for docker-compose setup and full reference.

Maintainers publishing from CI configure GitHub Actions secrets **`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`** and **`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`** — the workflow builds `Dockerfile.mcp` as **`featurefactory/mimir-mcp`** on each qualifying push (`main`, `release/**`, `feat/**`, releases, workflow dispatch). Legacy Azure Container Registry **`acrmimir`** was removed from the pipeline; when it is unused, tear it down in Azure (e.g. `az login` then `az acr delete --name acrmimir --yes`) and remove GitHub secrets **`ACR_USERNAME`** / **`ACR_PASSWORD`** if still present.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- IDE with MCP support (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Access credentials for HOMEBASE (optional, for syncing)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/petelind/mimir.git
   cd mimir
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   
   **Note:** The default database (`mimir.db`) includes the **FeatureFactory** playbook, which was used to build Mimir itself. This playbook provides a complete feature development workflow with 8 activities covering planning, implementation, testing, and finalization.

5. **Create admin user (or use default)**
   
   The database comes with a default admin account:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `admin`
   
   **For production or shared environments, create your own user:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   
   You'll be prompted for:
   - Username (required)
   - Email (optional, for password reset)
   - Password (minimum 8 characters)

6. **Run tests**
   
   Run unit and integration tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```
   
   > **Note**: BDD feature files in `docs/features/act-*/` serve as comprehensive UI specifications (46 files covering Acts 0-15). Step definitions will be implemented during development.

## Quick Reference

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start web UI (keep running in terminal)
python manage.py runserver 8000
# → Open http://localhost:8000

# Test MCP server manually (different terminal)
python manage.py mcp_server --user=admin
# → Press Ctrl+C to stop

# Run all tests
pytest tests/
# → Should see: 250 passed, 1 skipped

# Create a new user
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### MCP Configuration Files

- **Windsurf**: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Cursor**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

See the Quick Start section above for the config snippet.

## How to Use

Mimir runs as two processes that work together:

### 1. Start the Web Interface

```bash
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and log in with your credentials.

Once logged in, you can:
- **Browse playbooks**: View activities, workflows, phases, artifacts, roles, and howtos
- **Review PIPs**: Approve or reject Playbook Improvement Proposals
- **Compare versions**: See what changed between playbook versions
- **Edit locally**: Customize playbooks for your team

### 2. Configure MCP in Your IDE

Register at [mimir.featurefactory.io](https://mimir.featurefactory.io/auth/register/) to get your token, then add to your IDE config:

**Windsurf** (`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`) · **Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`) · **Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mimir": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "BASE_URL=https://mimir.featurefactory.io",
        "-e", "TOKEN=<your-token>",
        "-e", "MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio",
        "featurefactory/mimir-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For a local FOB, set `BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`. Restart your IDE after saving.

### 3. Use MCP Tools in Your IDE

Once configured, your AI assistant has access to **16 Mimir MCP tools** for managing playbooks, workflows, and activities:

#### Playbook Management (5 tools)
- **`create_playbook`** - Create new draft playbooks
- **`list_playbooks`** - List playbooks (filter by status: draft/released/all)
- **`get_playbook`** - Get detailed playbook info with nested workflows
- **`update_playbook`** - Update playbook details (auto-increments version)
- **`delete_playbook`** - Delete draft playbooks

#### Workflow Management (5 tools)
- **`create_workflow`** - Add workflows to playbooks
- **`list_workflows`** - List workflows for a playbook
- **`get_workflow`** - Get workflow details with activities
- **`update_workflow`** - Update workflow details
- **`delete_workflow`** - Delete workflows from playbooks

#### Activity Management (6 tools)
- **`create_activity`** - Add activities to workflows
- **`list_activities`** - List activities in a workflow
- **`get_activity`** - Get activity details with dependencies
- **`update_activity`** - Update activity guidance, name, phase
- **`delete_activity`** - Remove activities
- **`set_predecessor`** - Define activity dependencies (validates no circular deps)

**Example Usage:**
```
"Create a new playbook called 'Frontend Best Practices'"
"Add a workflow called 'Component Development' to playbook 5"
"List all activities in workflow 3"
"Update activity 7 to add more detailed guidance"
```

All tools support async operations and validate user permissions automatically.

## Typical Workflow

### Daily Development

1. **Configure your IDE** (one-time setup)
   
   Add Mimir to your IDE's MCP configuration (see section 2 above):
   - **Windsurf:** `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
   - **Claude Desktop:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Cursor:** Workspace settings or `.cursorrules`
   
   Restart your IDE after configuration.

2. **Start working with Mimir**
   
   Once configured, interact with Mimir through your IDE's AI assistant:
   
   ```
   "Mimir, list available playbooks"
   "Mimir, show me the Build Page workflow"
   "Mimir, plan FOB-LOGIN-1 per BPE1 Plan Feature"
   "Mimir, implement backend per BPE2"
   ```

3. **Optional: Web UI for management**
   
   Start the web interface to manage playbooks visually:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 8000
   ```
   
   Open http://localhost:8000 to:
   - Browse and edit playbooks
   - View workflows and activities
   - Manage methodology content
   
   **Note:** While a Playbook is in draft status, you can work with it directly: update, extend, and even delete - via both MCP and GUI. Once it's released, it can be revised only via PIPs (Playbook Improvement Proposals).

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Responding

1. **Verify your token works:**
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Token <your-token>" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/playbooks/
   ```

2. **Test the MCP facade manually:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -i \
     -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
     -e TOKEN=<your-token> \
     -e MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
     featurefactory/mimir-mcp:latest
   ```
   Send `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}` — you should get a list of 53 tools.

3. **Check IDE logs:**
   - **Windsurf**: View logs in MCP settings panel
   - **Claude Desktop**: Check `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
   - **Cursor**: Check IDE console for MCP connection errors

4. **Common issues:**
   - **"Image not found"**: Run `docker pull featurefactory/mimir-mcp:latest`
   - **"Unauthorized"**: Token expired — regenerate at your profile page
   - **"Connection refused"**: FOB not running — check `docker ps | grep mimir-fob`

### Database Locked

If you see "database is locked" errors:
```bash
# Ensure only one web server is running
pkill -f "manage.py runserver"

# Restart web server
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

## Project Structure

> **Note**: Internal code uses `methodology` as the technical term for accuracy (e.g., Django app name, models, commands), while user-facing terminology uses "playbooks" for accessibility. This is intentional - see [SAO.md](docs/architecture/SAO.md) for details.

### IDE-Specific Rules

Mimir maintains project rules in two formats to support different AI-powered IDEs:
- **`.windsurf/rules/*.md`** - For Windsurf IDE
- **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** - For Cursor IDE

Both rule sets contain identical content with different formatting. **If you use Cursor and modify rules**, ask your IDE to maintain sync between both formats to keep them consistent.

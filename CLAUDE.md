# CLAUDE.md — Mimir Development Guide

## What Is Mimir

Mimir is a **self-evolving engineering playbook platform**. It lets teams document, evolve, and leverage software development methodologies through a Django web UI and an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that AI assistants query directly.

**Two-part system:**
- **FOB (this repo)** — Django 5 app with SQLite, runs MCP server + web server concurrently
- **HOMEBASE** (separate repo) — Django + HTMX, eventing → Neo4j graph DB, aggregates PIPs from FOBs

**Key innovation:** AI assistants can propose playbook improvements (PIPs) that engineers review and approve.

**Current Status:** Production-ready MVP with full CRUDLF for Playbooks, Workflows, Activities, and Agents. MCP integration complete with 40+ tools.

```

### Data Model Hierarchy

```
Playbook (status: draft/released/disabled; version: 0.x → 1.0+)
  └─ Workflow (name, abbreviation, order)
       ├─ Phase (optional; currently string field, not separate model)
       └─ Activity (name, guidance: Markdown+Mermaid, order)
            └─ Artifact (input/output, producer/consumer)
Playbook also has: Agent (Act 7, not yet built), Skill (Act 8, not yet built)
```

**Implementation status:**
| Entity | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Playbook | ✅ Full CRUDLF |
| Workflow | ✅ Full CRUDLF + export/import |
| Activity | ✅ Full CRUDLF |
| Phase | ⚠️ String field only |
| Artifact | ⚠️ Model exists, partial |
| Agent | ✅ Full CRUDLF (Act 7) |
| Skill | ⚠️ Model exists, partial (Act 8) |
| PIP | ❌ Not built (Act 9) |

### Services Pattern

Services in `methodology/services/` are **shared by both UI views and MCP tools** — never add MCP-specific logic to services. MCP tools only add: user context lookup, permission check, serialization.

Version auto-increment (Activity update → increments grandparent Playbook version) happens in the MCP tool wrapper, not the service.

### MCP Access Rules

- **Draft playbooks** (v0.x): Full CRUD via MCP
- **Released playbooks** (v≥1.0): Read-only via MCP; changes must go through PIPs

---

## Terminology

| Internal Code | User-Facing UI |
|---------------|----------------|
| `methodology` (app, models, services) | "playbooks" |
| `MethodologyRepository` | — |
| `manage.py mcp_server` | — |

Always use "playbooks" in UI text; always use `methodology` in code.

## FeatureFactory Workflows

Mimir development follows the **FeatureFactory v3.8** playbook — a complete product development methodology from idea to shipped feature.

### Inception Phase (run once per project)

1. **ESM — Envision the System** (7 activities)
   - User journey, screen flows, feature files (BDD), IA guidelines, mockups
   - Output: `docs/features/**`, `docs/ux/screen-flow.drawio`

2. **DTA — Define Architecture** (18 activities)
   - Technical decisions across 16 domains → System Architecture Overview
   - Output: `docs/architecture/SAO.md`

3. **DSP — Deploy Software Process** (6 activities)
   - AI IDE configuration for Windsurf/Cursor/Claude
   - Output: `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurf/rules/`, `.cursor/rules/`

4. **EST — Estimate the Project** (8 activities)
   - Two-level estimates, Monte Carlo forecast, client quote
   - Output: `docs/plans/ESTIMATION_TEMPLATE.xlsx`

### Delivery Loop (repeats every sprint)

5. **BSP — Bootstrap Project** (Sprint 0 only, 8 activities)
   - Scaffold project structure, dependencies, Makefile
   - Output: Runnable project with welcome page

6. **BPE — Build Feature** (Every sprint, 8 activities)
   - **BPE-01**: Plan feature implementation
   - **BPE-02**: Implement backend (models → services → views)
   - **BPE-03**: Implement frontend (templates + HTMX)
   - **BPE-04**: Feature Acceptance Tests (Django test client)
   - **BPE-05**: Journey Certification Tests (Playwright E2E)
   - **BPE-06**: Check Definition of Done
   - **BPE-07**: Finalize feature (commit, PR)
   - **BPE-08**: Process change requests

**EST-08** runs at end of every sprint to rebaseline estimates.

### Before Implementing Any Feature

1. Read the relevant feature spec in `docs/features/act-*/`
2. Read `docs/architecture/SAO.md` for architectural context
3. Follow **BPE workflow** step-by-step (see `.windsurf/workflows/FeatureFactory/BPE/`)
4. Create implementation plan in `docs/plans/` (BPE-01)

### Skeleton-First Pattern

```python
def create_workflow(self, playbook, name, description):
    """Create a new workflow in the given playbook.

    Args:
        playbook: Playbook instance
        name: str workflow name
        description: str
    Returns:
        Workflow instance
    Example return: Workflow(id=1, name="Design Features", ...)
    """
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

Write stub → write test (red) → implement → test passes (green) → commit.

## Coding Conventions

### Commit Format (Angular Convention — strict)

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body — what changed and why>

<footer>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
Example: `feat(workflows): add export to JSON via MCP tool`

### Code Style

- Top-level methods: **20-30 lines max**; extract helpers for supporting logic
- Imports at **module level** — never inside functions
- Single responsibility per method
- Black + Ruff for formatting/linting

### Logging

- INFO level; log what/why/where/when
- Output to `logs/app.log`
- Include request/correlation IDs for debugging

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific category
pytest tests/unit/ -v
pytest tests/integration/ -v
pytest tests/e2e/ -v         # requires Playwright setup

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=methodology --cov=mcp_integration
```

**Key rules:**
- **Test-first**: write test before implementation
- **No mocks in integration tests**: use real objects/DB (rule: `do-not-mock-in-integration-tests.md`)
- Run tests after every change

---

## Running Locally

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate

# Web server (terminal 1)
python manage.py runserver 8000

# MCP server (terminal 2)
python manage.py mcp_server --user=admin

# Load demo data
python manage.py create_demo_fdd
```

Both processes share the same SQLite DB with a 20-second timeout for concurrent access.

## UI Patterns

- **No SPA / no React** — Django templates + HTMX only
- **Bootstrap 5.3+** for all styling; add CSS variables, not raw overrides
- **Graphviz** for workflow/activity diagrams
- **Mermaid.js** for inline diagrams in activity guidance (Markdown)
- Always add `data-testid` attributes to interactive elements for Playwright tests
- Tooltips on complex form fields (consistent pattern per `docs/ux/IA_guidelines.md`)

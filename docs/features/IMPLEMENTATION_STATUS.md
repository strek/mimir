# Mimir Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: November 29, 2025

This document tracks what has been implemented vs. what is documented in the user journey and design specifications.

---

- `Activity` model with fields:
  - `name` (CharField, max 200, unique per workflow)
  - `guidance` (TextField, rich Markdown content)
  - `order` (IntegerField, auto-assigned if not provided)
  - `phase` (CharField, optional grouping)
  - `has_dependencies` (BooleanField, documentation flag only)
  - `workflow` (ForeignKey to Workflow)
  - Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Unique constraint: `['workflow', 'name']`

  - Order number
  - Dependencies badge (informational)
  - Timestamps
  - Edit/Delete buttons (if owner)
  
- **EDIT** (`/playbooks/<pk>/workflows/<pk>/activities/<pk>/edit/`):

- Phases shown as subgraphs
- "Add Activity" button visible to owners
- Empty state with "Create First Activity" button

#### **✅ Activity Service Layer**
- `ActivityService` with methods:
  - `create_activity()`: Validation, auto-order, name uniqueness
  - `update_activity()`: Field updates with validation
  - `delete_activity()`: Safe deletion
  - `duplicate_activity()`: Copy with new name
  - `get_activities_by_phase()`: Grouped retrieval
- Comprehensive logging at INFO level

#### **✅ Demo Data**
- **FDD Playbook**: Feature-Driven Development methodology
- **Management Command**: `python manage.py create_demo_fdd`
- **2 Workflows**: "Design Features" (5 activities), "Implement Features" (5 activities)
- **10 Activities** with production-quality Markdown guidance:
  - Mermaid diagrams (class, sequence, flow)
  - Python code examples with docstrings
  - Bash/Git command examples
  - YAML configuration examples
  - Tables (feature lists, test matrices, issue tracking)
  - Task checklists
  - Multi-level documentation structure

## ⚠️ **Partially Implemented / Documentation Only**

### **Has Dependencies Field**
- **Current State**: Boolean flag stored in database
- **Current Behavior**:
  - ✅ Checkbox in create/edit forms
  - ✅ Badge display in list/detail views
  - ❌ **Does NOT track which activities are dependencies**
  - ❌ **Does NOT enforce execution order**
  - ❌ **Does NOT validate dependency completion**
- **Purpose**: Documentation indicator that activity has prerequisites
- **Planned Enhancement**: Replace with Many-to-Many relationship for actual dependency tracking

### **Phase Assignment**
- **Current State**: String field (optional)
- **Current Behavior**:
  - ✅ Dropdown in create/edit forms
  - ✅ Badge display in views
  - ✅ Grouping in list views
  - ✅ Subgraphs in Graphviz diagrams
  - ❌ **No separate Phase model/CRUD yet**
- **Note**: Phase is **OPTIONAL** - workflows function without phases

---

## ❌ **Not Yet Implemented**

### **Activity-Related Features from User Journey**

#### **Role Assignment** (Act 7 dependency)
- Field: `role` (ForeignKey to Role)
- Role model not yet created
- Form dropdown for role selection
- Role badge in activity views

#### **Artifact Production** (Act 6 dependency)
- M2M relationship: `Activity.artifacts`
- Artifact model not yet created
- "What does this activity produce?" section in forms
- Artifact list in activity detail view

#### **Skill Guides** (Act 8 dependency)
- 1:1 relationship: `Activity.skill`
- Skill model not yet created
- "Create Skill" checkbox in activity create form
- Skill tab in activity detail view

#### **Estimated Effort Field**
- Field for hours or story points
- Not in current model

#### **Dependency Graph Visualization**
- Visual dependency diagram in activity detail
- Requires actual M2M dependency relationships
- Currently only have boolean flag

#### **Work Items Integration** (External MCP)
- Tab showing linked GitHub issues/Jira tickets
- Requires external MCP servers
- "Create Work Item" button

## 📋 **Test Status**

### **Unit Tests**
- ✅ `test_activity_model.py`: 3/3 passing
  - Create activity with all fields
  - Default values
  - String representation

- ✅ `test_activity_graph_service.py`: 11/11 passing
  - Graphviz diagram generation
  - Phase grouping
  - Uniform node colors

### **Integration Tests**
- ✅ `test_activity_create.py`: 7/7 passing (updated for guidance)
- ✅ `test_activity_delete.py`: 8/8 passing (updated for guidance)
- ⚠️ `test_activity_edit.py`: Some tests need fixes (28 failed, 14 passed)
- ⚠️ `test_activity_view.py`: Some tests need fixes
- ⚠️ `test_activity_list.py`: Some tests need fixes

**Note**: Most failures are due to test expectations around dependencies/roles/artifacts that aren't fully implemented yet.

## 🎯 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

1. **Fix Remaining Integration Tests** (High Priority)
   - Update assertions to match current implementation
   - Remove tests for unimplemented features (roles, artifacts, skills)
   - Achieve 100% test pass rate

2. **Dependency Enhancement** (Medium Priority)
   - Add M2M relationship: `dependencies = models.ManyToManyField('self')`
   - Update forms with multi-select for upstream/downstream
   - Add circular dependency validation
   - Update Graphviz service to show dependency arrows
   - Remove or repurpose `has_dependencies` boolean

3. **Phase Model** (Medium Priority - Optional Feature)
   - Create `Phase` model with workflow FK
   - Implement Phase CRUDLF (Act 4)
   - Update activity forms to use Phase FK instead of string
   - Add "Phases are OPTIONAL" messaging throughout

4. **Role Model** (Low Priority)
   - Create `Role` model (Act 7)
   - Add FK to Activity model
   - Implement Role CRUDLF
   - Update activity forms

5. **Artifact Model** (Low Priority)
   - Create `Artifact` model (Act 6)
   - Add M2M relationship to Activity
   - Implement Artifact CRUDLF
   - Update activity forms

6. **Skill Model** (Low Priority)
   - Create `Skill` model with 1:1 to Activity (Act 8)
   - Implement Skill CRUDLF
   - Add tab in activity detail view

## 📝 **Architecture Notes**

### **Activities as Static Reference Material**
- **Key Principle**: Activities are like pages in a technical book
- **No Status Tracking**: Removed `status` field (was: not_started, in_progress, etc.)
- **No Work Item Tracking**: Done in external systems (GitHub, Jira)
- **Purpose**: Provide reusable guidance and methodology documentation

### **Markdown-First Approach**
- Activities use rich Markdown instead of plain text
- Encourages detailed, well-formatted guidance
- Supports technical documentation patterns (code, diagrams, tables)
- Renders beautifully in web UI with Mermaid diagrams

### **Service Layer Pattern**
- All business logic in `ActivityService`
- Views are thin controllers
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Validation centralized in service methods

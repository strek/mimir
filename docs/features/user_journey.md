## System Architecture Note

**Homebase (HB)**: Central server with two interfaces:
- **HB Django Admin**: System administrator functions (approvals, user management) - uses standard Django Admin interface
- **HB Web Interface**: Public-facing registration and information pages

**FOB (Forward Operating Base)**: Local containerized application with:
- **FOB Web GUI**: Custom Django application with full UI for playbook and family management
- **Mimir MCP Server**: Provides playbook context, guidance, and PIP suggestions to AI assistants in Windsurf
- **FOB Database**: Local PostgreSQL with playbook graph storage
- **HB Connection**: Optional token-based authentication to sync with Homebase
  - Can operate standalone (local-only) or connected to one HB
  - Django DRF token issued upon HB registration
  - Token can be added, changed, or removed in FOB Settings
  - **Limitation**: Only one Homebase connection supported per FOB

**External Integrations**:
- **Work Item Management**: Handled by external 3rd party MCP servers (GitHub MCP, Jira MCP, GitLab MCP, etc.)
- **Note**: Mimir MCP provides playbook context; external MCPs handle work item creation/tracking

**Domain Model Notes**:
- **7 Core Entities**: Playbook, Workflow, Phase, Activity, Artifact, Role, Skill
- **Phase is OPTIONAL**: Workflows MAY contain Phases for grouping Activities, but Phase is not required. A Workflow can organize Activities with or without Phase grouping.
- **Artifact**: Formerly called "Deliverable" in some contexts. Use "Artifact" consistently for outputs produced by Activities.
  - **Producer/Consumer Model**: Each artifact is produced by exactly one activity (output) and can be consumed by multiple downstream activities (inputs)
  - **Flow Tracking**: Artifacts create dependencies between activities - an activity may require specific artifacts as inputs before it can execute
  - **Examples**: API Specification (produced by "Design API" → consumed by "Implement API", "Test API", "Document API")

---

## ⚠️ Critical Architectural Principle

**Playbooks Are STATIC Reference Material (Like a Book)**

- **Mimir playbooks** = Documentation and guidance ONLY
  - Show activity structure, descriptions, best practices
  - NO work item tracking, NO status indicators, NO checkmarks
  - Think of them as reference books or documentation wiki pages

- **Work item tracking** = Happens ONLY in external systems
  - GitHub Issues, Jira Tickets, Atlassian boards
  - Status, progress, assignments managed there
  - Actual work execution tracked there

- **AI/MCP integration** = Cross-references between the two
  - Reads static playbook from Mimir: "Activity 1: Setup Project - install dependencies, configure environment"
  - Reads live status from GitHub: "Issue #47: Setup React project - Status: Closed"
  - Provides combined context: "According to the playbook, Activity 1 covers setup. GitHub shows issue #47 for this work is complete."

**Example**:
- **FOB displays**: "Activity 1: Setup Project" with rich Markdown guidance (static)
- **GitHub displays**: "Issue #47: Setup React project structure - Closed on Nov 15" (live tracking)
- **AI combines**: "Per the React Frontend Development playbook, you need to set up the project. GitHub issue #47 shows this work is complete."

**This separation ensures**:
- Playbooks remain reusable across projects and teams
- Work tracking stays in familiar developer tools
- No duplicate tracking systems

## Journey: From Discovery to Contribution

### Act 0: System Entry & Authentication

**Context**: Users need to access the system. FOB and HB have separate authentication flows.

**Background**: Mike previously registered on Homebase and received his Django DRF authentication token (`mimir_x7k9m2...`). As a system administrator, he primarily works through the Django Admin interface on HB and doesn't need a FOB instance.

#### Screen: HB Login Page
Mike navigates to Homebase login at `https://homebase.mimir.io/login`:
- Email field
- Password field
- "Remember me" checkbox
- "Forgot password?" link
- "Sign up" link (→ Registration, generates token upon email verification)
- "Login" button

Mike enters credentials and clicks Login.

#### Screen: HB Django Admin Dashboard (System Admin View)
Mike (system admin) sees standard Django Admin interface:
- Django Admin navigation sidebar
- Recent actions log
- Quick links to models:
  - Users
  - Families
  - Playbooks (pending approval)
  - Notifications
- System health indicators

**Note**: This is Django's built-in admin interface, not custom UI.

#### Screen: FOB Login/Startup
Maria's FOB container starts automatically with her dev environment:
- Container initialization screen
- FOB authentication:
  - If first time: Setup wizard (covered in Act 1)
  - If returning: Automatic login with stored credentials
- Database connection check
- MCP server status: ✓ Running

#### Error Path: FOB Connection Failed
If FOB can't reach Homebase:
- Error modal: "Cannot connect to Homebase"
- Options:
  - "Retry Connection"
  - "Work Offline" (limited features)
  - "Check Connection Settings"

---

### Act 0.1: The Foundation (Mike's Setup)

**Context**: Mike wants to share his React development methodology with the community.

#### Screen: HB Admin Dashboard
Mike logs into the Homebase admin interface. He sees the main dashboard with playbook management tools and family administration.

#### Screen: HB Create Playbook Wizard
Mike clicks "Create New Playbook" and enters:
- **Name**: "React Frontend Development"
- **Description**: "Component architecture, state management, and testing patterns"
- **Category**: Development

#### Screen: HB Playbook Editor
Mike uses the visual editor to structure his playbook:
- Adds Activities: "Setup Project", "Create Components", "Implement State Management"
- Adds Artifacts: "Component Library", "State Diagram", "Test Suite"
- Links Activities with dependencies (upstream/downstream relationships)

#### Screen: HB Family Assignment
Mike assigns the playbook to the "Usability" family:
- Selects "Usability" from family dropdown
- Sets visibility to "Public" (anyone in family can access)
- Clicks "Publish"

#### Screen: HB Pending Approval
After publishing, Mike sees:
- Status: "Pending Admin Approval"
- Message: "Your playbook has been submitted for review by Homebase administrators"

#### Django Admin: HB Playbook Approval (System Administrator)
Sarah, the Homebase system administrator, receives a notification in Django Admin:
- Navigates to **Django Admin → Playbooks → Pending Approvals**
- Sees list view with pending playbooks
- Clicks on "React Frontend Development" playbook
- Django Admin detail view shows:
  - Playbook structure, description, target family
  - Author information
  - Submission timestamp
- Actions dropdown: "Approve", "Reject", "Request Changes"
- Selects "Approve" and saves

#### Screen: HB Playbook Activated
Mike receives notification:
- "Your playbook 'React Frontend Development' has been approved"
- Status: "Active in Usability family"

**Result**: The playbook is now available to all members of the Usability family.

---

### Act 1: Maria's Onboarding

**Context**: Maria heard about Mimir and wants to try it for her UX practice.

#### Screen: HB Registration Page
Maria navigates to Mimir's registration page on Homebase and fills out the form:
- Email: maria@uxconsulting.com
- Password: (creates secure password)
- Full Name: Maria Rodriguez
- Clicks "Register"

#### Screen: HB Email Verification
Maria receives a verification email and clicks the confirmation link. She's redirected back to Homebase.

#### Screen: HB Registration Success - Authentication Token
After email verification, Maria sees her account details page:
- **Congratulations!** Your Mimir account is active.
- **Your Authentication Token** (copy button):
  ```
  Token: mimir_a8f3d9e2b1c4567890abcdef12345678
  ```
- **Important**: Save this token securely. You'll need it to connect your FOB to Homebase.
- **Homebase URL**: `https://homebase.mimir.io`
- Options:
  - "Download FOB Setup Guide" (PDF with token and URL)
  - "Regenerate Token" (invalidates old token)
  - "Continue to FOB Setup"

**Note**: This Django DRF token authenticates FOB to HB for sync operations.

#### Screen: HB/FOB Setup Wizard
After saving her token, Maria is guided through FOB (local workspace) setup:
- Downloads FOB container image (Docker-based Mimir container)
- Container includes:
  - Django web application (FOB GUI)
  - PostgreSQL database (local playbook graph storage)
  - Mimir MCP server (provides playbook context to AI assistants)
- Maria configures the container in Windsurf as a dev container
- Configures local storage volume mount

#### Screen: FOB First Launch - Homebase Connection (Optional)
FOB starts and shows connection configuration:
- **Connect to Homebase** (Optional)
  - Homebase URL: [https://homebase.mimir.io]
  - Authentication Token: [paste token here]
  - "Test Connection" button
- **Or skip this step**:
  - "Skip - Work Locally" button
  - Note: "You can always add Homebase connection later in Settings. Without HB connection, you won't be able to sync playbooks from families."

Maria pastes her token and clicks "Test Connection":
- ✓ Connection successful
- Shows her account: maria@uxconsulting.com
- "Continue" button

#### Screen: FOB Sync Preferences
After connecting to Homebase:
- Sets sync preferences (manual vs. notification-based)
- Configures auto-sync settings

#### Screen: FOB External MCP Configuration
Maria **separately configures external MCP servers in Windsurf**:
- GitHub MCP for work item management
- (Optional: Jira MCP, GitLab MCP, etc.)

**Result**: Maria now has a working FOB connected to Homebase with token-based authentication.

---

### Act 1.5: FOB Navigation Structure

**Context**: Understanding the persistent navigation and UI structure of FOB.

#### Screen: FOB Main Interface Layout
Maria's FOB web GUI (http://localhost:8000) has a consistent layout:

**Top Navigation Bar** (persistent across all screens):
- **Logo**: "Mimir FOB" (links to Dashboard)
- **Connection Status**: 
  - If connected to HB: Green indicator "✓ Connected to Homebase"
  - If local only: Gray indicator "⊝ Local FOB" with tooltip "Not connected to Homebase. Sync disabled."
- **Search**: Global search bar (playbooks, families, activities)
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Dashboard
  - Playbooks (with count badge)
  - Families (with count badge)
  - Sync (disabled if no HB connection)
  - Settings
- **Notifications**: Bell icon with badge count (unread notifications)
- **User Menu**: Maria Rodriguez dropdown
  - My Profile
  - Account Settings
  - Homebase Connection (manage token)
  - Log Out

**Left Sidebar** (contextual, shown on detail pages):

- Recently viewed playbooks
- Active playbook indicator

---

#### Screen: FOB Dashboard (Main Landing Page)

**Context**: The dashboard is the main landing page after login. It provides quick access to Maria's work and shows what she's been using recently.

**Layout**:

**Section 1: My Playbooks** (Top section)
- Grid/list of 5 most recently accessed playbooks
- Each playbook card shows:
  - Name and description
  - Version badge
  - Status badge (Draft/Released)
  - Last accessed timestamp (e.g., "Opened 2 hours ago")
- [View All Playbooks] link → FOB-PLAYBOOKS-LIST+FIND-1
- Empty state: "No playbooks yet" with [Create Playbook] button

**Section 2: Recently Used** (Middle section - informer style)
- **Purpose**: Show what Maria has been actively working with and how often
- **NOT an audit trail**: Does not track all user actions, only tracks access/usage for quick navigation
- Table showing:
  - **Item Name** | **Type** | **Times Used** | **Last Used** | **Quick Action**
- Item types: Playbook, Workflow, Activity
- Sorted by: Last Used (most recent first)
- Shows: Last 10 items
- **Times Used**: Simple counter incremented each time item is viewed/accessed
  - Playbook: Viewed detail page
  - Workflow: Viewed detail page
  - Activity: Viewed detail page
- **Quick Action**: [View] button → navigates to item's detail page
- Example rows:
  - "React Frontend Development" | Playbook | 15 times | 2 hours ago | [View]
  - "Component Development" | Workflow | 8 times | 3 hours ago | [View]
  - "Setup Project" | Activity | 12 times | 5 hours ago | [View]
- Empty state: "No recent usage yet"

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This is NOT a comprehensive audit log or activity tracking system. It only tracks views/access for the purpose of showing recently used items as quick navigation shortcuts. It does not track create/update/delete operations.

**Section 3: Quick Actions** (Bottom section)
- Three prominent action buttons:
  - [+ New Playbook] → FOB-PLAYBOOKS-CREATE_PLAYBOOK-1
    - Icon: fa-plus-circle
    - Tooltip: "Create a new playbook from scratch"
  - [Import Playbook] → Import feature (disabled in MVP)
    - Icon: fa-file-import
    - Tooltip: "Import playbook from JSON file (coming soon)"
    - Disabled state with gray styling
  - [Sync with Homebase] → Sync feature (disabled if no HB connection)
    - Icon: fa-sync
    - Tooltip: "Download playbooks from Homebase families" (or "Connect to Homebase first" if no connection)
    - Disabled if no HB connection configured

Maria uses this dashboard to quickly resume her work and navigate to frequently accessed items.

#### Screen: FOB Notification Center
Maria clicks the bell icon (badge shows "3"):
- Dropdown panel appears:

  - Status: Active, Disabled, Archived
  - Source: Local, Downloaded, Owned
- **Results list** with relevance ranking
- **Empty state**: "No results found" with suggestions

---

### Act 2: PLAYBOOKS - Complete CRUDLF

**Context**: After onboarding, Maria needs to manage playbooks - the top-level container for methodologies. She can create her own, view downloaded ones, edit them, and delete obsolete ones.

**Pattern**: Playbook follows the standard CRUDLF pattern with LIST+FIND as the entry point.

#### Screen: FOB-PLAYBOOKS-LIST+FIND-1

Maria clicks "Playbooks" in the main navigation. The playbooks list page appears (this is the entry point for all playbook operations, marked with bold border in flow diagrams):

**Layout**:

  - [Create Playbook] [Browse Families] [Import JSON] buttons
- **Pagination**: Shows 20 per page with page controls

**Example Data**:
- "React Frontend Development" | Mike Chen | v1.2 | Active | Downloaded
- "UX Research Methodology" | Maria Rodriguez | v2.1 | Active | Owned
- "Design System Patterns" | Community | v1.0 | Disabled | Downloaded

Maria sees her existing playbooks and can search/filter to find specific ones.

---

#### Playbook Versioning & Lifecycle System

**Context**: Mimir implements automatic versioning to track playbook evolution while enforcing change control for released methodologies.

**Versioning Rules**:

1. **Draft Status** (v0.1, v0.2, v0.3, ...):
   - New playbooks start at **v0.1**
   - Every change automatically increments version by 0.1
   - Changes include:
     - Editing playbook metadata (name, description, etc.)
     - Adding/editing/deleting workflows
     - Adding/editing/deleting activities in workflows
     - Adding/editing/deleting any related entities
   - Draft playbooks are **fully editable** via GUI and MCP
   - Version increments happen automatically (transparent to user)

2. **Released Status** (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0, ...):
   - When user releases a draft playbook → version becomes **v1.0**
   - Released playbooks are **read-only** in GUI and MCP
   - Any attempt to edit shows message:
     - "This playbook is Released and cannot be edited directly. Please submit a PIP (Process Improvement Proposal) to make changes."
   - Changes can only be made via **PIP workflow** (ACT 9)
   - Each approved PIP increments major version (1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0)

**Example Lifecycle**:
```
Create Playbook (Draft)     → v0.1
Add 2 workflows              → v0.2  (auto-increment)
Edit playbook description    → v0.3  (auto-increment)
Add 5 activities to workflow → v0.4  (auto-increment)
Edit activity #3             → v0.5  (auto-increment)
[User clicks "Release"]      → v1.0  (status: Released)
[Try to edit - blocked]      → Error: "Use PIP to change"
Submit PIP with changes      → PIP workflow
PIP approved and merged      → v2.0  (new released version)
```

**Status Badge Colors**:
- Draft: Yellow/Warning (editable, evolving)
- Released: Blue/Primary (stable, controlled)
- Active: Green/Success (deprecated status, use Draft or Released)
- Disabled: Gray/Secondary (archived, not in use)

**User Actions**:
- **Release Draft**: Draft v0.x → Released v1.0
  - One-way operation (cannot revert to draft)
  - Accessible from playbook detail page
  - Confirmation modal explains implications
- **Submit PIP**: Only way to change Released playbooks
  - Creates PIP proposal with proposed changes
  - Requires review/approval workflow
  - See ACT 9: PIPs for complete flow

**MCP Integration**:
- MCP can read both draft and released playbooks
- MCP can suggest edits only to draft playbooks
- For released playbooks, MCP suggests creating PIP instead
- MCP tools check playbook status before allowing mutations

Maria now understands that her new draft playbooks will auto-version as she works on them, and once released, they become controlled artifacts that require formal change proposals.

- ✅ **CREATE**: Create new playbooks with wizard guidance
- ✅ **VIEW**: Explore playbook details, workflows, and history
- ✅ **EDIT**: Update playbook metadata, workflows, and settings
- ✅ **DELETE**: Remove playbooks with full impact warnings

**Navigation Flow**: Dashboard → Playbooks LIST+FIND (entry point) → Individual operations (CREATE/VIEW/EDIT/DELETE) → Back to LIST+FIND

**Next**: Maria proceeds to manage Workflows within her playbooks (ACT 3).

---

### Act 3: WORKFLOWS - Complete CRUDLF

**Context**: Within a playbook, Maria needs to manage workflows - the execution sequences that contain activities. A playbook typically has multiple workflows representing different paths or phases of the methodology.

**Pattern**: Workflow follows standard CRUDLF with LIST+FIND as entry point. Workflows are always scoped within a parent playbook.

**Important Note**: Workflows MAY optionally contain Phases for grouping Activities, but Phases are not required. See Act 4 for Phase management.

### Act 3.5: MCP Workflow Synchronization (Export/Edit/Import)

**Context**: Maria wants to leverage her AI assistant (Windsurf/Cursor) to collaboratively edit workflow activities. The MCP server provides tools to export workflows as markdown files, edit them locally with AI assistance, and import changes back with automatic change tracking.

**Use Case**: Maria has a "Frontend Development" workflow with 15 activities. She wants to refine the activity descriptions, reorder steps, and add new activities using her AI assistant's help. Instead of clicking through the GUI, she exports the workflow to `.windsurf/workflows/FFE/`, edits the markdown files with AI assistance, and imports the changes back.

**Important**: This feature respects the playbook versioning system:
- **Draft playbooks**: Changes imported directly, version auto-increments
- **Released playbooks**: Changes create PIPs automatically (see Act 9)

---

#### MCP Tool: `export_workflow_to_local`

**Purpose**: Export a workflow and its activities as markdown files to `.windsurf/workflows/` or `.cursor/workflows/` for local editing.

**MCP Call**:
```python
# AI assistant calls this via MCP
mcp.export_workflow_to_local(
    workflow_id=42,
    target_directory=".windsurf/workflows",  # or ".cursor/workflows"
    folder_name="FFE"  # Optional, defaults to workflow slug
)
```

**What It Does**:
1. Creates folder: `.windsurf/workflows/FFE/`
2. Generates `_workflow.md` with workflow metadata:
   ```markdown
   # Frontend Development Workflow
   
   **Playbook**: React Frontend Development v0.5 (Draft)
   **Workflow ID**: 42
   **Description**: Complete frontend development process from setup to deployment
   **Phase Organization**: Uses phases (Foundation, Implementation, Testing)
   **Total Activities**: 15
   **Export Date**: 2026-02-05 11:45 UTC
   
   ## Activities
   See individual activity files: FFE-01-*.md through FFE-15-*.md
   ```

3. Creates one `.md` file per activity:
   - Filename pattern: `FFE-{order:02d}-{slug}.md`
   - Example: `FFE-01-Setup_Project.md`, `FFE-02-Configure_Build.md`
   
4. Activity file format:
   ```markdown
   # Activity: Setup Project
   
   **Activity ID**: 123
   **Order**: 1
   **Phase**: Foundation (optional)
   **Dependencies**: None (or list of upstream activity IDs)
   
   ## Description
   Initialize the React project with proper tooling and configuration.
   
   ## Guidance
   1. Run `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`
   2. Configure ESLint and Prettier
   3. Set up folder structure: src/components, src/utils, src/hooks
   4. Install core dependencies: react-router-dom, axios
   
   ## Artifacts Produced
   - Project Structure (artifact_id: 456)
   - Configuration Files (artifact_id: 457)
   
   ## Artifacts Consumed
   None
   
   ## Notes
   Use TypeScript template for better type safety.
   ```

**Success Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "exported",
  "workflow_id": 42,
  "workflow_name": "Frontend Development",
  "export_path": "/Users/maria/project/.windsurf/workflows/FFE",
  "files_created": [
    "_workflow.md",
    "FFE-01-Setup_Project.md",
    "FFE-02-Configure_Build.md",
    "... (15 total activity files)"
  ],
  "message": "Workflow exported successfully. Edit files locally and use import_workflow_from_local to apply changes."
}
```

**GUI Integration**:
- Available from FOB-WORKFLOWS-VIEW_WORKFLOW-1
- New button: [Export to AI Workspace] with icon `fa-file-export`
- Tooltip: "Export workflow activities as markdown files for AI-assisted editing"
- Opens modal to select target directory and folder name
- Shows success message with file count and path

---

#### Local Editing Phase

**Context**: Maria and her AI assistant now have markdown files to work with.

**Typical Workflow**:
1. Maria asks AI: "Review the FFE workflow activities and suggest improvements"
2. AI reads all `FFE-*.md` files
3. AI suggests: "Activity 3 should come before Activity 2 for better dependency flow"
4. Maria: "Make that change and also add a new activity for API integration testing"
5. AI edits the files:
   - Renames `FFE-02-*.md` → `FFE-03-*.md`
   - Renames `FFE-03-*.md` → `FFE-02-*.md`
   - Creates `FFE-16-API_Integration_Testing.md`
   - Updates `_workflow.md` to reflect 16 activities
6. Maria reviews the changes in her IDE's diff view
7. Maria: "Looks good, import these changes back to FOB"

**File Editing Rules**:
- **Add activity**: Create new `FFE-XX-Name.md` file
- **Remove activity**: Delete the `.md` file
- **Reorder**: Rename files to change order numbers
- **Edit content**: Modify description, guidance, dependencies in markdown
- **Change phase**: Update the `Phase:` field in frontmatter

---

#### MCP Tool: `import_workflow_from_local`

**Purpose**: Import edited workflow files back into FOB, with automatic change detection and protocol generation.

**MCP Call**:
```python
# AI assistant calls this via MCP
mcp.import_workflow_from_local(
    workflow_id=42,
    source_directory=".windsurf/workflows/FFE",
    auto_apply=False  # If True, applies immediately for draft playbooks
)
```

**What It Does**:

**Step 1: Change Detection**
- Compares local `.md` files with current FOB workflow state
- Identifies:
  - **New activities**: Files that don't match existing activity IDs
  - **Modified activities**: Files with changed content (description, guidance, dependencies)
  - **Deleted activities**: FOB activities missing from local files
  - **Reordered activities**: Changed order numbers
  - **Phase changes**: Activities moved between phases

**Step 2: Generate Upload Protocol**
- Creates `_Upload_Protocol.md` in the same directory:

```markdown
# Upload Protocol: Frontend Development Workflow

**Generated**: 2026-02-05 12:15 UTC
**Workflow**: Frontend Development (ID: 42)
**Playbook**: React Frontend Development v0.5 (Draft)
**Source**: .windsurf/workflows/FFE/

## Change Summary

**Total Changes**: 4
- New Activities: 1
- Modified Activities: 2
- Deleted Activities: 0
- Reordered Activities: 2

## Detailed Changes

### 1. NEW ACTIVITY: API Integration Testing

---

## Approval Options

### Option A: Apply Immediately (Draft Playbooks Only)
If this playbook is in Draft status, changes can be applied directly.
- Workflow will be updated
- Playbook version will auto-increment (v0.5 → v0.6)
- No PIP required

**Command**: `mcp.apply_upload_protocol(protocol_file="_Upload_Protocol.md")`

### Option B: Submit as PIP (Released Playbooks)
If this playbook is Released, changes must go through PIP workflow.
- PIP will be created with these changes
- Requires review and approval
- Upon approval, playbook version increments (v1.0 → v2.0)

**Command**: `mcp.create_pip_from_protocol(protocol_file="_Upload_Protocol.md")`

### Option C: Cancel
Discard these changes and keep FOB workflow unchanged.

---

## Edit This Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: Review and edit the **Rationale** fields above before applying.

Explain WHY each change improves the workflow. Good rationales help reviewers understand the value of changes, especially for PIPs.

**Example Good Rationale**:
"Reordered to ensure dependencies are installed before build configuration, preventing build errors during setup."

**Example Poor Rationale**:
"Changed order" ← Too vague, doesn't explain benefit
```

**Step 3: User Review & Edit**
- User (Maria) reviews `_Upload_Protocol.md`
- Fills in rationale fields
- Can modify the protocol:
  - Remove changes she doesn't want
  - Add more context to rationales
  - Adjust change descriptions

**Step 4: Application**

**For Draft Playbooks** (auto_apply=True or manual approval):
```python
mcp.apply_upload_protocol(
    protocol_file=".windsurf/workflows/FFE/_Upload_Protocol.md"
)
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "applied",
  "workflow_id": 42,
  "playbook_version": "v0.6",  # Auto-incremented
  "changes_applied": {
    "new_activities": 1,
    "modified_activities": 2,
    "reordered_activities": 2,
    "deleted_activities": 0
  },
  "message": "Changes applied successfully. Playbook version incremented to v0.6."
}
```

**For Released Playbooks**:
```python
mcp.create_pip_from_protocol(
    protocol_file=".windsurf/workflows/FFE/_Upload_Protocol.md",
    pip_title="Improve Frontend Development workflow activity flow"
)
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "pip_created",
  "pip_id": 789,
  "pip_title": "Improve Frontend Development workflow activity flow",
  "workflow_id": 42,
  "playbook_id": 15,
  "changes_count": 4,
  "next_steps": "PIP submitted for review. Track status at FOB-PIPS-VIEW_PIP-789",
  "message": "PIP created successfully. Changes will be applied upon approval."
}
```

---

**Act 3 Summary**: Maria can now manage workflows:
- ✅ **LIST+FIND**: Browse workflows within a playbook
- ✅ **CREATE**: Create new workflows with optional phase organization
- ✅ **VIEW**: Explore workflow structure, activities, and dependencies
- ✅ **EDIT**: Update workflow details, reorder, manage activities
- ✅ **DELETE**: Remove workflows with impact warnings
- ✅ **EXPORT**: Export workflows to AI workspace as markdown files
- ✅ **IMPORT**: Import edited workflows with change tracking and protocol generation
- ✅ **SYNC**: Bidirectional sync between FOB structured data and AI workspace files

**Key Points**: 
- Workflows MAY use Phases for grouping, but Phases are optional (see Act 4)
- MCP workflow sync respects versioning: Draft = direct apply, Released = PIP workflow
- Upload Protocol provides change tracking and rationale documentation

**Next**: Maria can optionally organize workflow activities into Phases (ACT 4).

---

### Act 4: PHASES - Complete CRUDLF ⚠️ **OPTIONAL ENTITY**

**Context**: Phases are OPTIONAL groupings for activities within workflows. Maria can choose to use phases for organizing complex workflows into stages, or she can manage activities directly without phases. Not all workflows need phases.

**Pattern**: Standard CRUDLF, but with prominent "OPTIONAL" messaging throughout.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE**: Phase is an OPTIONAL entity. Workflows function perfectly without phases. Use phases only when logical grouping adds value to your workflow organization.

#### Screen: FOB-PHASES-LIST+FIND-1

From FOB-WORKFLOWS-VIEW_WORKFLOW-1, if workflow uses phases, Maria clicks [Manage Phases]. The phases list appears:

**Layout**:

- **Header**: "Phases in Component Development workflow"
- **Optional Badge**: Prominent yellow badge: "⚠️ OPTIONAL FEATURE - Phases are not required"
- **Info Banner**:  
  "Phases are optional groupings for activities. Your workflow can function without phases. Use phases to organize activities into logical stages if it helps your methodology."
- **Top Actions**:
  - [Create New Phase] button
  - [Remove All Phases] button (converts workflow to non-phased)
  - [Reorder Phases] (drag-and-drop)
- **Phases Table**:
  - Name | Description | Activities | Order | Actions
  - Drag handles for reordering
- **Row Actions**:
  - [View] → FOB-PHASES-VIEW_PHASE

- **Empty State** (for workflows without phases):
  - "This workflow doesn't use phases"
  - "Activities are organized directly in the workflow"
  - "Add phases if you want to group activities into stages"
  - [Add First Phase] [Keep Without Phases] buttons

**Example Data**:
- "Foundation" | Setup and configuration | 3 Activities | Order: 1
- "Implementation" | Core development work | 5 Activities | Order: 2

---

#### Screen: FOB-PHASES-CREATE_PHASE-1

Maria clicks [Create New Phase]:

**Form**:
- **Phase Name**: Text input

  - [Move to Different Phase] buttons
  - [Remove from Phase] (makes activity unassigned)
- **Phase Navigation**:
  - [Previous Phase] [Next Phase] buttons
  - Link back to workflow view

---

#### Screen: FOB-PHASES-EDIT_PHASE-1

Edit phase details, reorder, reassign activities.

**Form**: Name, Description, Order, Activity assignments

**Special Options**:
- [Merge with Another Phase]
- [Split Phase] (divide activities into two phases)
- [Dissolve Phase] (remove phase, keep activities in workflow)

---

#### Screen: FOB-PHASES-DELETE_PHASE-1

Confirmation modal:

**Impact**:
- "Activities in this phase will remain in the workflow (unassigned to any phase)"
- Shows: 5 activities will become ungrouped
- Note: "Deleting a phase does NOT delete activities"

**Actions**: [Cancel] [Delete Phase]

**Success**: Phase removed, activities remain in workflow

---

**Act 4 Summary**: Maria can optionally use phases:
- ✅ **LIST+FIND**: View phases in a workflow (if used)
- ✅ **CREATE**: Add phases to group activities
- ✅ **VIEW**: See phase organization
- ✅ **EDIT**: Reorganize phases and activities
- ✅ **DELETE**: Remove phases without losing activities

**⚠️ Key Reminder**: Phases are OPTIONAL. Workflows work perfectly without them.

**Next**: Maria manages Activities - the core work units (ACT 5).

---

### Act 5: ACTIVITIES - Complete CRUDLF

**Context**: Activities are the core work units in a methodology. Each activity represents a specific task or action to be performed. Activities have dependencies, produce artifacts, are performed by roles, and have detailed skill guides.

**Pattern**: Standard CRUDLF. Activities are the heart of the workflow execution.

---

**🎉 Acts 2-8 Complete!** All 7 core entities (Playbooks, Workflows, Phases, Activities, Artifacts, Roles, Skills) now have full CRUDLF coverage with narrative explanations.

**Demo Playbook Available**: A Feature-Driven Development (FDD) demo playbook with 10 activities showcasing rich Markdown guidance is available via `python manage.py create_demo_fdd`. This demonstrates:
- Mermaid diagrams (class, sequence, flow)
- Code examples (Python, Bash, YAML)
- Tables and checklists
- Multi-level documentation structure

**Next**: Maria can propose improvements via PIPs (ACT 9) and manage import/export (ACT 10).

---

### Act 9: PIPs - Playbook Improvement Proposals

**Context**: As Maria uses playbooks (whether her own or downloaded from others), she discovers opportunities for improvement. PIPs (Playbook Improvement Proposals) are the mechanism for suggesting, tracking, and applying changes to playbooks.

**Key Concepts**:
- PIPs can be created manually by users or suggested by AI
- Local PIPs: Applied immediately to local playbook versions
- Submitted PIPs: Sent to original playbook author for review
- PIPs create versioned changes (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1 local)

#### Creating a PIP

**Trigger**: While using "React Frontend Development" playbook (authored by Mike), Maria notices it lacks accessibility considerations.

**Via AI Assistant (Windsurf/MCP)**:

Maria asks her AI assistant:
```
> mimir: This React playbook is great, but it doesn't mention accessibility testing. 
  I think we should add an Activity for "Accessibility Audit" after testing setup. 
  Can you help me create a PIP for this?
```

AI responds:
```
I'll help you create a Playbook Improvement Proposal (PIP).

Proposed PIP:
- Type: Extension (new Activity)
- Target Playbook: React Frontend Development v1.0 by Mike Chen
- Change: Add new Activity "Accessibility Audit"
- Position: After "Component Testing"  
- Description: "Ensure React components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
- Includes:
  • Install axe-core and jest-axe
  • Add accessibility tests to component suite
  • Configure automated a11y checks in CI/CD

Shall I create this PIP in your local FOB?
```

Maria confirms: `> mimir: Yes, create the PIP`

#### Screen: FOB-PIP-CREATE (via MCP or GUI)

System creates PIP:
- **PIP ID**: PIP-42
- **Title**: "Add Accessibility Audit Activity"
- **Type**: Extension
- **Target**: React Frontend Development v1.0
- **Author**: Maria Rodriguez
- **Status**: Draft (local only)
- **Changes Preview**: Shows diff-style comparison
  - Current structure (v1.0)
  - Proposed structure (v1.1 with new activity)

**Actions Available**:
- [Apply Locally] - Creates local v1.1
- [Submit to Author] - Sends PIP to Mike for review
- [Edit PIP] - Modify proposal
- [Discard] - Delete draft

#### Action: Apply PIP Locally

Maria clicks [Apply Locally]:
- Confirmation: "This will create React Frontend Development v1.1 (local)"
- Playbook updated immediately
- Success: "PIP-42 applied. Playbook updated to v1.1 (local)"
- Version badge changes: "v1.1 (local)" indicates local modifications

**Result**: Maria now has an enhanced version with accessibility considerations.

#### Action: Submit PIP to Author

Later, Maria decides to share her improvement:
- Opens PIP-42 details
- Clicks [Submit to Author]
- Modal: "Submit PIP to Mike Chen?"
  - "This will send your proposal for review"
  - "Mike can accept, request changes, or decline"
  - Optional message to author
- Maria adds: "Great playbook! I added a11y audit based on WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
- Clicks [Submit]

**Notification Flow**:
- PIP sent to Homebase
- Mike receives notification: "Maria Rodriguez submitted PIP-42 to React Frontend Development"
- Maria sees: "PIP-42 submitted for review"

#### Screen: FOB-PIP-LIST (Manage PIPs)

Maria can view all her PIPs:
- **My Submitted PIPs**: 
  - PIP-42: Accessibility Audit (Pending Review by Mike)
  - PIP-38: State Management Patterns (Accepted - merged to v1.2)
- **Received PIPs** (for her owned playbooks):
  - PIP-55: Add Figma integration (from Alex - Pending Maria's review)
- **Local PIPs** (applied but not submitted):
  - PIP-40: Personal workflow tweaks (UX Research playbook)

**Filters**: Status (Draft, Submitted, Accepted, Declined), Playbook, Author

#### Reviewing Received PIPs (Playbook Owner View)

When Mike reviews Maria's PIP-42:

**Screen: FOB-PIP-REVIEW**:
- Shows complete PIP details
- Side-by-side diff view
- Comments/discussion thread
- Actions for owner:
  - [Accept & Merge] - Incorporates changes, publishes new version
  - [Request Changes] - Sends feedback to Maria
  - [Decline] - Rejects with reason

Mike clicks [Accept & Merge]:
- React Frontend Development updates to v1.2
- All family members notified of new version
- PIP-42 marked as "Accepted"
- Maria's contribution credited in version history

**Result**: Collaborative playbook evolution through structured improvement proposals.

#### AI-Initiated PIPs

**Context**: AI observes Maria's work patterns and proactively suggests improvements.

**Scenario**: After Maria completes several components with accessibility features, AI notices the pattern:

```
✓ Components created: Button, Card, Modal (all with focus traps, ARIA labels)
✓ Accessibility tests added to each component

I notice you're consistently adding accessibility features, but the playbook 
doesn't explicitly call for focus trapping in modals. Based on your work patterns, 
should we update the playbook to include:
  - Focus trap implementation guidelines
  - Keyboard navigation requirements  
  - ARIA attribute checklist

Would you like me to create a PIP for these additions?
```

Maria: `> mimir: Yes, great observation! Create the PIP`

AI creates PIP-43 automatically, Maria reviews and applies/submits as needed.

---

**Act 9 Summary**: Maria can evolve playbooks through PIPs:
- ✅ Create PIPs manually or via AI assistance
- ✅ Apply PIPs locally for immediate use
- ✅ Submit PIPs to original authors for community contribution
- ✅ Review and merge PIPs received on owned playbooks
- ✅ Track PIP status and version history
- ✅ AI learns from patterns and suggests improvements

**Key Benefits**: Structured change management, version control, collaborative improvement, AI-assisted evolution.

**Next**: Maria manages import/export operations (ACT 10).

---

### Act 10: IMPORT/EXPORT - Playbook Distribution

**Context**: Maria needs to share playbooks outside the Homebase sync system - for backups, offline distribution, cross-instance transfer, or client delivery.

**Key Formats**:
- **JSON**: Structured data format for programmatic use

**Resolution Options**:
- ○ **Download v1.2** (recommended): Replaces local with official version
- ○ **Keep Local v1.1**: Stay on your version, opt out of updates
- ○ **Merge**: Combine local + remote changes (advanced)

Maria selects **Download v1.2**:
- Downloads official version
- Local v1.1 archived to version history
- Success: "Updated to React Frontend Development v1.2"

---

#### Scenario D: True Conflict - Divergent Changes

**Context**: Maria modified Activity 2 locally. Mike also changed Activity 2 in v1.3. Changes conflict.

**Screen: FOB Conflict Resolution (Conflict Detected)**

Shows conflicts:
- **Activity 2**: "Create Components"
  - Your change: Added accessibility checklist
  - Remote change: Restructured component architecture
  - Status: ⚠️ **CONFLICT**

**Resolution Options**:
- ○ **Accept Remote**: Use Mike's v1.3 (lose your changes)
- ○ **Keep Local**: Stay on v1.2 with your changes
- ○ **Manual Merge**: Open editor to combine both

**Actions**:
- [View Diff] - See line-by-line changes
- [Accept Remote] - Take Mike's version
- [Keep Local] - Keep your version
- [Contact Author] - Message Mike about conflict

Maria chooses [Accept Remote] (trusts Mike's architecture):
- Downloads v1.3
- Her local changes archived
- Can create new PIP later if needed

---

**Act 12 Summary**: Maria syncs playbooks with Homebase:
- ✅ Download community playbooks from families
- ✅ Preview before downloading
- ✅ Upload PIPs to contribute improvements
- ✅ Handle version updates and conflicts
- ✅ Resolve conflicts (accept, keep, merge)
- ✅ Offline resilience (downloaded playbooks work without connection)

**Key Points**:
- Sync requires Homebase connection and authentication
- Downloaded playbooks available offline with full CRUDLF
- PIPs enable structured contribution workflow
- Version control prevents data loss
- Conflict resolution preserves user choice

**Next**: Maria uses playbooks via MCP in her IDE (ACT 13).

### Act 13: MCP INTEGRATION - AI-Assisted Methodology Execution

**Context**: Maria works in Windsurf IDE with Mimir MCP server providing playbook context. External MCPs (GitHub, Jira) handle work items.

#### Setup: MCP Configuration

Maria's Windsurf has two MCP servers configured:
1. **Mimir MCP** (localhost:5000): Provides playbook context, activities, artifacts
2. **GitHub MCP** (external): Creates/tracks GitHub issues

FOB container runs Mimir MCP server, exposing playbook data via Model Context Protocol.

---

#### Using Active Playbook

**Screen: FOB Dashboard**

Maria activates "React Frontend Development" playbook:
- Clicks on playbook
- [Activate] button
- Success: "React Frontend Development v1.2 is now active"

**Windsurf/MCP Chat**

Maria asks her AI assistant:
```
> mimir: I'm starting a new React project. How do I set up the project structure?
```

**MCP Response** (from Mimir MCP):
```
Based on "React Frontend Development" playbook, Activity 1: Setup Project:

1. Initialize with Create React App or Vite
2. Folder structure:
   - /src/components (reusable UI)
   - /src/pages (page-level)
   - /src/hooks (custom hooks)
   - /src/state (state management)
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier  
4. Set up Jest + React Testing Library

Upstream: None
Downstream: Create Components, Implement State Management

Would you like me to create a GitHub issue to track this?
```

---

#### Creating Work Items via External MCP

Maria responds:
```
> mimir: Yes, create a GitHub issue for project setup
```

**GitHub MCP** (external server) creates issue:
- **Repo**: maria/acme-dashboard
- **Issue #47**: "Setup React project structure per React Frontend Development playbook"
- **Body**: Includes checklist from Activity 1 (context from Mimir MCP)
- **Labels**: setup, react, playbook

Link returned to Maria.

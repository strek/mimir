  Background:

    And PIP-42 exists:
      | field           | value                                         |
      | id              | 42                                            |
      | title           | Add Accessibility Audit                       |
      | summary         | React playbook lacks WCAG 2.1 AA coverage     |

      | status          | Reviewed                                      |
    And PIP-42 has the following Changes:
      | # | type  | entity_type | name / target             | position / rationale                          |
      | 1 | ADD   | Activity    | Accessibility Audit       | After: Component Testing (id=22)              |
      | 2 | ALTER | Activity    | Component Testing (id=22) | Add axe-core alongside existing Jest tests    |
    And Galdr has assessed PIP-42 with the following recommendations:
      | change | recommendation       | reasoning                                                                                   |
      |      1 | ACCEPT               | Consistent with Testing phase goal; no upstream conflicts detected.                         |
      |      2 | REJECT               | Proposed content removes the required Artifact link to "Test Suite", breaking dependencies. |

## Description

Define Application Blocks

## Guidance

# Define Application Blocks

## Objective

Identify bounded contexts, domain packages, module boundaries, and dependency rules. Choose the foundational architectural pattern (MVC, event-driven, modular monolith, microservices, etc.).

---

## Internal Process

Every domain activity follows this structure:

1. **Identify needs** — what does ESM require for this domain?
2. **Scan Skills** — query Playbook Skills by `capability_domain` for this domain
3. **Propose options** — 2-3 approaches with Skill coverage, cost, risk
4. **Record decision** — user picks, rationale documented

---

## Decisions to Make

### 1. Bounded Contexts / Domain Packages

- Review ESM entities and their relationships
- Group entities into cohesive domain packages
- Define which entities belong together (high cohesion) vs. which are separate concerns (loose coupling)
- Example groupings:
  - `auth/` — User, Session, Permissions
  - `methodology/` — Playbook, Workflow, Activity, Skill
  - `planning/` — WorkPlan, Task, Estimation
  - `mcp/` — MCP protocol, tools, stdio interface

### 2. Module Boundaries & Dependency Rules

- Define what can import what (dependency direction)
- Identify shared kernel vs. independent modules
- Example rules:
  - `planning` → depends on `methodology` (reads playbook structure)
  - `mcp` → depends on `methodology` (exposes methodology as tools)
  - `auth` → independent (no methodology dependency)
  - No circular dependencies allowed

### 3. Foundational Architectural Pattern

Choose one:
- **MVC / MTV** — Model-Template-View (Django default). Best for: server-rendered web apps with moderate complexity.
- **Event-Driven** — Publish/subscribe, event sourcing. Best for: highly decoupled systems, real-time requirements.
- **Modular Monolith** — Single deployable unit with strict module boundaries. Best for: starting simple with clear growth path.
- **Microservices** — Independent deployable services. Best for: large teams, independent scaling needs.
- **Batch Processing** — Scheduled jobs processing data in bulk. Best for: data pipelines, ETL.
- **Hybrid** — Combine patterns (e.g., MVC for web + event-driven for async).

### 3a. UI Architecture Patterns (if system has a web/desktop UI)

Define the presentation layer architecture:

**Rendering model**:
- **Server-rendered** — HTML generated on server (Django templates, Jinja2). Best for: testability, SEO, minimal JS.
- **SPA** — Single Page Application (React, Vue, Svelte). Best for: rich interactivity, complex state.
- **Hybrid** — Server-rendered with progressive enhancement (HTMX, Alpine.js, Turbo). Best for: server-side simplicity with dynamic UX.

**Layout pattern**:
- **Single-panel** — One main content area. Best for: simple CRUD, mobile-first.
- **Multi-panel** — Split layout (navigation + content + detail). Best for: explorer-style UIs, dashboards.
- **Wizard/stepper** — Sequential steps. Best for: complex forms, onboarding.

**Component interaction model**:
- **Full page reload** — Traditional links/forms. Simplest, most testable.
- **Partial updates** — Server returns HTML fragments, client swaps them (HTMX, Turbo Frames). Testable with standard server-side tests.
- **Client-side state** — JS manages state, talks to API (React+Redux, Vue+Pinia). Requires browser-based testing.

**Visualization approach** (if applicable):
- **Server-generated** — Graphviz, matplotlib, SVG generation on server. Best for: static/semi-static diagrams.
- **Client-rendered** — D3.js, Cytoscape.js, Chart.js. Best for: interactive, real-time visualizations.
- **Hybrid** — Server generates data, client renders. Best for: large datasets with interactive exploration.

Document rationale for each choice, especially impact on **testability** and **build complexity**.

### 4. Scan Skills & Reference Implementations

Query Playbook Skills where `capability_domain` in:
- `APP_STRUCTURE`
- `DOMAIN_MODELING`
- `DEPENDENCY_INJECTION`

Report coverage:
```
Skill Coverage for Application Blocks:
  APP_STRUCTURE    | [Django App Architecture Skill] ✅
                   | Reference: Repository pattern, service layers, dependency rules
                   | Example: Mimir methodology/ app structure
  
  DOMAIN_MODELING  | [DDD Bounded Contexts Skill] ✅  
                   | Reference: Entity modeling, aggregate boundaries
                   | Example: Playbook → Workflow → Activity hierarchy
  
  DEPENDENCY_INJECTION | ❌ No Skill - will create custom patterns
                       | Estimated impact: +1 iteration for pattern definition
```

If reference implementations exist: "Following Django app patterns from [Django App Architecture Skill](#skill-456), recommend service layer approach with estimated 2-day implementation."

If gaps exist: "No Skill for Dependency Injection — will need to define patterns. Estimated impact: +1 iteration."

---

## Deliverables

- ✅ **Bounded contexts / domain packages** identified and documented
- ✅ **Module dependency rules** defined (what imports what)
- ✅ **Foundational pattern** chosen with rationale
- ✅ **UI architecture patterns** defined (if applicable): rendering model, layout, interaction model, visualization
- ✅ **Skill coverage** assessed for this domain with reference implementations
- ✅ **Decision recorded** for inclusion in SAO.md (DTA-18)
